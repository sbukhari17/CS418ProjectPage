											<h3 class="major">Syed Bukhari</h3>
											<p>I'm an undergrad CS student in my final semester at UIC. I've had a handful of internships that have given me the opportunity to work with the results of data science but never with data science at its root. I look forward to using Chi411 as the starting point to propel myself into the world of Data Science, Big Data, and Data Analytics.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Amna Irfan</h3>
											<p>I am graduate student at UIC. Last year I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor in Linguistics.
												Since the past 3 years, I have been working as a full-stack developer at LeadFuze which is a marketing startup.
												In terms of my research experience, I have worked on statistical topic models (mostly LDA) and dialogue systems as an undergraduate student.
												I am fluent in Java, Python, GoLang, C#. During the research analysis phase of my projects, I also had the
												chance to work in R-studio and SAS. Something personal about me? I am crazy cat lady. </p>
